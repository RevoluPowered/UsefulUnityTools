# UsefulUnityTools
A set of scripts I use in my projects, useful to anyone else who may want to use them.

These are written in C#, and I use them in a few of the games I've created. 

Feel free to modify these, obviously some of the code may not run in your game because of the Unity version differences. Please contact me if you have any issues or use the bug tracker.

# Upcoming changes / what's in this repository
Documentation will be comming soon. Each 'module' can be used seperately without modification. The code in these files will be updated for Unity 5.3 as soon as possible.
